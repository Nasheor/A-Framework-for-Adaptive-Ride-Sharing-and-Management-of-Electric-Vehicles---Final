First and foremost, I extend my deepest gratitude to my supervisors Nacho, Alan and Pio for their unwavering guidance and support throughout this journey. In particular, I would like to thank Nacho for going above and beyond in supporting me during the most challenging times of the COVID-19 pandemic. His understanding, encouragement, and timely advice were invaluable as I navigated the shift to remote work, battled homesickness, and strove to meet important deadlines.

I am also grateful to my parents and friends, whose love, patience, and steadfast encouragement have kept me motivated over these past years. Thank you for believing in me, for celebrating every milestone, and for putting up with my highs and lows as I pursued this PhD.

Finally, this research would not have been possible without the generous funding provided by Science Foundation Ireland under Grant number 18/CRT/6222. Their support has been instrumental in enabling me to undertake and complete this work.

% I would also like to acknowledge Confirm SmartQC project providing the opportunity to enhance the DLT decision support tool
